This manual is aimed to everyone else that wants to work with me so that we have a common understanding which in
turn promoting a team dynamic while working together with me. This is inspired by Rafeequl, CTO at Sleekr at the time, which as he pointed out was originated from the following links:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I am:
- Highly motivated individual driven by goals. So without goals I can't even fall asleep.
  You know, falling asleep needs more motivation than we think :p
- An extroverted introvert who always tries to be as inclusive as I can so nobody got left out.
- Easily bored with tedious or repetitive work.
- Reasonably stubborn.

## My quirk:
- A sarcastic creature breaking ice with much of a sarcasm as I can think of.
- My mind has its own world. Hard to focus on a task in the beginning but once I focus, no task is impossible.
- Therefore sometimes I need to re-read those meetings minutes in my own time or re-learn those things
  at training or workshop that I attended.
  
 ## What I value:
 - Honesty, don't sugar coat things
 - Inclusivity, engaging people in any situation whenever possible. We not I. Unless you work alone.
 - Perseverance in a time of crisis and dedication where work is not just daily routine.
 - Up for challenges. That's why I am easily bored with tedious work 
 - Respect between team members. Don't be condescending
 - Dealing with someone else's failure in private, not publicly denouncing them

## How I work:
- My mind is throttled in the morning around 8 - 11 and slowing down until around 4 (4 - 8 with moderate speed). Pick
  up the speed again at 8 - 10.
- Hard for me to do multiple things at once
- Need my own time to focus on my work. As the say "wired in"
- I can have as many meetings as anybody want, but don't expect me to be at my fullest while working on something else
  (in this case coding, documentation, etc.) with those many meetings. (back to the point where I can't do multiple
  things at once)
- Also I don't believe in meetings, discussion yes, but not meetings without any goal. Excessive or stretched meeting
  tend to kill the time that's so precious.
  
## What drives me nut:
- Blaming others doesn't solve anything. Look for solution through discussion instead.
- Seeking attention, especially by taking credit of others.
- Distraction, unless you really need to.
- Argument without giving solution.


## How to communicate with me:
- Leave a message on things that can wait. Unless emergency
- Give me context of what's happening before asking for opinion
- Be patient on me of not following, sometimes got left behind thinking of other scenarios (or solution) of
  problems at hand while you are keep talking
- Keep reminding me of things I need to followup. Hard to follow all those tasks at once.


## What people misunderstand about me:
- Refer to the point of me being a sarcastic person. So bear with me :)
- On silent mode, don't think of me of not being participating, I'm thinking here.
  If you need my opinion right away, call me out.
  

Hopefully with this we can have a great working environment that embraces respects between each other in the team.
Everyone has its own pace. Happy collaborating :)
