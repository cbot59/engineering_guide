- Nickname: Alul

## My Style
- I loved to work in public area, where I can enjoy the ambiance as white noise, often I put headset on to listen nature white noise
- My mind like rabbit, I think in not linear line; I'll jump very rapidly from limited evidence to an explanation.
- I like to share knowledge with other, sometime I learn a lot from pairing with other
- I am comfortable changing direction, shifting and adapting. I also love new ideas but this can be challenging for people
	
## My work hours:
- I reach office before 10:00, because in the morning I'm little bit busy to take care of my son. When I reach office I can directly start working from checking all notification and email, had team discussion and other light work until lunch time. My prime time for working on heavy task with full speed and stable is around 14:00-17:00

## What I Value:
- Independence and innovation. I like people who find solutions rather than problems
- Dedication. I prefer it when people value what they are doing, when it's more than just a job
- I recognize effort and contributions, and will give credit in public
- Improvement and Kaizen!

## What I don't have patience for
- Yak shaving, Often to do one thing, we have to do other things which the predecessor's activities often look useless
- Professional people acting like victims of change and not seeing & using their own power to lead change
- Parallel work, hard to switching contex quickly
- People being territorial, putting their interests over our collective ones
- Finding problems and not taking responsibility for finding solutions
	
## What’s the best way to communicate with me?
* For most thing I am open and approachable and will provide any advice and support needed, just poke me, I'm prefer talking over writing chat
* But keep in mind that I'm always on edge when talking with people, especially about important things
* I have dedicated time on my pomodoro time for checking notification, so when I haven't replied chat in 30 minutes you can make a call

## How to help me
* dare to take the challenge
* I embrace challenging the status quo and normal ways of doing things and get energy from thinking about how we could do things differently
* I love trusting people to get on with things, but I do like to be involved at key points and kept up to speed, enabling me to increase my confidence and trust in people
	
## What people misunderstand about me:
* My joking style is a sarcastic joke, oftern it taken seriously
* I often think while I speak. Some people find it easy for me to switching decisions inconsistently
* I can lose confidence if I don’t hear about progress. When this happens I can start to get into details, which can feel disempowering for people

	
## Things I’m more than happy to talk about:
* Football match, game console FIFA and PES
* Technical books
* Sea food, coffee and tea
